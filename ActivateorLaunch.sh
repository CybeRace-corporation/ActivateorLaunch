# ******** NOTES **********
# In order for this script to work correctly you need to pass the complete process 
# name for it to find any visible windows. The process needs needs to be in the path
# for it to execute if not running.
#
# For example
#
# If you try it with firefox-bin on Ubuntu 10.10 it will find the running process and 
# activate the window, but it will not be able to launch the process since the executable 
# in the path is called firefox which is a link to firefox.sh
# (/usr/bin/firefox -> ../lib/firefox-3.6.12/firefox.sh) which in turn executes firefox-bin
# (not in path).
#
# Next, if you use firefox it will find a process but won't be able to find any windows 
# since it's a wrapper function calling firefox-bin and doesn't have any windows.
